# 🩺 CardioNLP – Bilingual AI Assistant for Cardiovascular Risk

## 🌍 Why This Matters

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally. Early risk detection can save lives — but many patients are underserved due to language barriers, fragmented data, and opaque algorithms.

**CardioNLP** addresses these challenges by:
- Integrating structured and unstructured data for richer insights
- Supporting bilingual output to improve accessibility
- Using interpretable models clinicians can trust
- Simulating federated learning to protect patient privacy

This project reflects Sanofi’s mission to use AI for good, promote health equity, and transform healthcare through ethical innovation.
